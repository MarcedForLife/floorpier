This project contains small CSS tweaks for [Floorp](https://floorp.app) (or Firefox) and [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/).

## Screenshots

## Usage

Follow the steps below to install these CSS tweaks into Floorp (or Firefox)

1. Enter `about:profiles` in the navigation/URL bar.
2. Click the `Open Folder/Show in Finder` button for the `Root Directory` entry of your desired browser profile.
3. Copy the contents of the [./src/](./src/) folder into the previously opened profile folder.
4. Restart Floorp/Firefox.

### Changing Defaults

You can adjust most aspects of the tweaks by modifying the custom properties within the [./src/chrome/components/config.css](./src/chrome/components/config.css) file.

Note that, you'll need to restart your browser to see any changes.

## Floorp Icon/Logo

I don't *love* the official Floorp logo, so I have been using [Havn/Erlend's fantastic rendition](https://havn.blog/2024/05/03/what-if-the.html) instead (and included it in the repo).
